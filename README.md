This is the final project for CSCI060 HM -- Principle of Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College

## Overview
Spampede is a snake-like game implemented in Java using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The game involves controlling a snake to navigate a grid, consuming spam, and avoiding collisions with walls and itself. The project showcases key concepts in game development, including real-time animation, user input handling, and AI-based pathfinding.

## Features
 - MVC Architecture: Clean separation between game logic, data management, and graphical representation.
 - User Controls: Control the snake's movement using keyboard inputs.
 - AI Mode: AI-driven snake movement using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
 - Real-Time Animation: Smooth, responsive game animations with customizable refresh rates.
 - Sound Effects: Audio feedback for in-game events like eating spam and game over.
